## ⚡️ Quick start
Start the executable of this file simply by using
```bash
./main helloworld.bf
```

## 🏗️ Building

For building the program first install GNU COBOL:
### 📦 Installing
Install dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get -y install build-essential libgmp-dev libdb-dev libncurses-dev \
  libcjson-dev libxml2-dev
```
Download the source code from the website and extract it.
From within the downloaded folder, run:
```bash
make
sudo make install
```
After installation, add the following line to the `~/.bashrc` file.
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LOAD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/lib
```
### 🚧 Building
After installing GNU COBOL this program can be build by using the following command:
```bash
cobc -x main.cbl
```

### 🐞 Debuging
For debuging I suggest the VS-Code extension called "COBOL debugger - Oleg Kunitsyn".
Info: for this extension to work, it is required to have the GNU debugger (gdb) installed.
